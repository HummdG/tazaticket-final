# Flight Search State Machine Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated a conversation state machine with the existing LangGraph flight search application. The system now tracks user input across conversation turns, validates required fields, and only performs searches when all information is complete.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed ConversationFlowSM.py

- **Fixed typo**: `detcted_language` → `detected_language`
- **Moved methods**: All methods moved out of `__init__` to proper class level
- **Fixed logic errors**:
  - Corrected `get_missing_variables()` method to properly iterate over variable mappings
  - Fixed round-trip condition from "round trip" to "round-trip"
  - Added proper return statement to `get_missing_variables()`

### 2. Enhanced TravelportSearch.py

- **Added response parsing helpers**: Complete set of functions to extract flight details, baggage info, and pricing from Travelport API responses
- **Updated tool signature**: Now accepts `payload` and `trip_type` parameters
- **Enhanced return format**: Returns structured response with `ok`, `error`, `summary`, and legacy `price` fields
- **Added error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for OAuth and API failures

### 3. Updated Payload Builders

- **OneWayFlightSearch.py**: Fixed to return payload, updated parameter names to match state machine fields
- **RoundTripFlightSearch.py**: Fixed to return payload, supports dynamic passenger count and carrier selection

### 4. Completely Rewrote actual_app.py

- **State machine integration**: One state machine instance per thread_id with proper persistence
- **Intelligent parsing**: Extracts cities, dates, passenger count, trip type from natural language
- **Language detection**: Basic multi-language support (English, Spanish, French, Turkish)
- **IATA mapping**: Automatic mapping of common city names to airport codes
- **Field validation**: Only performs search when all required fields are present
- **Rich formatting**: Detailed flight summaries with duration, stops, baggage info

## New Features

### State Machine Authority

- One state machine instance per `thread_id`
- Persisted via existing LangGraph memory
- All conversation turns update the state machine before any other processing

### Smart Input Parsing

- **Trip type detection**: Recognizes "one-way", "round-trip", "return" keywords
- **City extraction**: Parses "from X to Y" patterns with noise filtering
- **Date parsing**: Supports "next Friday", ISO dates, US date formats
- **Passenger count**: Extracts number from natural language
- **Language detection**: Auto-detects user language for appropriate responses

### Enhanced Search Results

- **Duration formatting**: Shows flight time as "2h 45m"
- **Stops display**: "non-stop", "1 stop", "2 stops"
- **Baggage summary**: Carry-on/checked status with allowances and penalties
- **Multi-language support**: Responses in detected language

### IATA Code Mapping

Built-in mapping for common cities:

- London → LHR, Paris → CDG, Istanbul → IST
- New York → JFK, Los Angeles → LAX, etc.

## Example Conversation Flows

### Missing Origin (Happy Path)

```
User: "Find flight to Istanbul next Friday"
Bot: "Where would you like to fly from? Please provide the city name or airport code."
User: "London"
Bot: "Which airport: LHR/LGW/STN/LTN?" (if ambiguous)
User: "LHR"
Bot: [Performs search and returns results]
```

### Complete One-Way

```
User: "London to Istanbul next Friday, 1 passenger"
Bot: ✈️ One-way flight found: 450.00 USD
🛫 Flight: 3h 45m, non-stop
Baggage: carry-on ✓ (1P), checked ✗ | Validating airline: TK
```

### Complete Round-Trip

```
User: "LHR to IST December 25th back December 30th, 2 passengers"
Bot: ✈️ Round-trip flight found: 850.00 USD

🛫 Outbound: 3h 45m, non-stop
   Baggage: carry-on ✓ (1P), checked ✗ | Validating airline: TK
🛬 Return: 4h 10m, 1 stop
   Baggage: carry-on ✓ (1P), checked ✗ | Validating airline: TK
```

## Technical Architecture

### State Machine Flow

1. **Parse user input** → Extract any available flight search parameters
2. **Update state machine** → Set detected fields
3. **Check completeness** → Validate all required fields present
4. **If incomplete** → Ask for missing fields in user's language
5. **If complete** → Build payload, call TravelportSearch, format results, reset state machine

### Field Tracking

- `detected_language`: en/es/fr/tr (auto-detected)
- `mode_of_conversation`: text/voice (defaults to text)
- `origin`: IATA code (mapped from city names)
- `destination`: IATA code (mapped from city names)
- `departure_date`: YYYY-MM-DD format
- `number_of_passengers`: Integer (defaults to 1)
- `type_of_trip`: "one-way" or "round-trip"
- `return_date`: YYYY-MM-DD (required for round-trip)

### Integration Points

- **Memory**: Uses existing LangGraph InMemorySaver
- **API**: Existing TravelportSearch tool with enhanced response parsing
- **Endpoint**: Maintains `/webhook` signature for Twilio integration
- **Response**: TwiML format preserved for WhatsApp integration

## Testing Completed

✅ State machine basic functionality  
✅ Round-trip flow handling  
✅ Payload builders working  
✅ Missing field detection  
✅ Integration components  
✅ Input parsing accuracy

## Files Modified

- `app/statemachine/ConversationFlowSM.py` - Bug fixes and improvements
- `app/tools/TravelportSearch.py` - Enhanced with response parsing
- `app/payloads/OneWayFlightSearch.py` - Fixed return and parameters
